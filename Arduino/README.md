# Arduino IDE

## Overview

Program with [Arduino IDE]. The RPUlux has the same ATmega328p as an Uno. It is wired on the board like I would do when using six Spakfun [FemtoBuck] (or two [PicoBuck]).

# Bootload Port

Connect an [FTDI Friend] or [USBuart] to the bootload port.

# Firmware Upload

Use the IDE to select an Uno for programing and then upload the sketch.
