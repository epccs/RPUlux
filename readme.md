## Overview

Board with ATmega328p and six AL8805 constant current drivers and headers for multi-drop serial Shields

This programmable ATmega328p based board has headers for a [RPUpi] or [RPUadpt] mezzanine shield. User's firmware application can monitor the input current with a high side current sense (ZXCT1087) with ADC channel six, and the input voltage with a voltage divider on channel seven. Six AL8805 based constant current sources are provided for LED strings. The current sources are PWM modulated at 500Hz with the OCnA and OCnB outputs from Timer0, Timer1, and Timer2.

## Example

TBD

I will use this board with an RS-422 shield so there is no USB interface (e.g. [RPUftdi] has a USB to RS-422 bridge).


## AVR toolchain

The core files for this board are in the /lib folder. Each example has its files and a Makefile in its own folder. The toolchain is available as standard packages on Ubuntu and Raspbian. 

```
sudo apt-get install git gcc-avr binutils-avr gdb-avr avr-libc avrdude
git clone https://github.com/epccs/Punica/
```

* [binutils-avr](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=binutils-avr)
* [gdb-avr](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=gdb-avr)
* [avr-libc](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=avr-libc)
* [avrdude](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=avrdude)

The software is a guide, it is in C because that works for me.
