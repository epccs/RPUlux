# Hardware

## Overview

This board has an ATmega328p and and six AL8805 constant current LED drivers. The reset is TBD.

Bootloader options include [optiboot] and [xboot]. Serial bootloaders can't change the hardware fuse setting which reduces programming errors that can accidentally brick the controller.

## Inputs/Outputs/Functions

```
        ATmega328p programs are compiled with open source tools that run nearly everywhere.
        Input power can range from 7 to 36V DC
        High side current sense of input power is connected to ADC6.
        Input power voltage is divided down and connected to ADC7.
        Three digital or analog input/outputs (D14/ADC0,D15/ADC1,D16/ADC3) with level conversion.
        IO4, IO7, and IO8 control current sinking N-CH MOSFET connected to ADC0, ADC1, and ADC2.
        IO12 and IO13 each control 22mA current source.
```

## Uses

```
        Six AL8805 buck converters drive constant current through LED channels
        Each LED channel has a 500Hz PWM control line from the ATmega328p.
        Allows control of two RGB color lighting sources.
        Sink solar panel power when the battery is full, and measure approximate current with Rds_on.
```

## Notice

```
        AREF from ATmega328p is not connected to the header.
        3V3 is not present on the board, the header pin is not connected.

# Assembly

## SMD

The board is assembled with CHIPQUIK no-clean solder SMD291AX (RoHS non-compliant). 

The SMD reflow is done in a Black & Decker Model NO. TO1303SB which has the heating elements controlled by a Solid State Relay and an ATMega328p loaded with this [Reflow] firmware.
